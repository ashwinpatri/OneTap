## Overview

OneTap is a Chrome extension that brings Capital One to every checkout. It automatically detects purchase pages, surfaces your best available offer, and lets you complete a transaction without leaving the page. Sign in once with Google — it handles the rest.

---

## Features

- Detects checkout pages and applies your best Capital One offer automatically
- One-tap payment via securely injected card details
- Split transactions across multiple Capital One cards
- Non-intrusive overlay that only appears when relevant
- Google OAuth sign-in — no passwords stored

---

## Installation

OneTap is not yet listed on the Chrome Web Store. Load it manually in a few steps.

**1. Download**

Clone the repository or download the ZIP directly:

```
https://github.com/ashwinpatri/CapitalOneTap/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

Unzip to a permanent location — Chrome requires the folder to remain in place.

**2. Open Extensions**

Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser.

**3. Enable Developer Mode**

Toggle **Developer mode** on in the top-right corner.

**4. Load Unpacked**

Click **Load unpacked** and select the `CapitalOneTap` folder (the one containing `manifest.json`).

**5. Sign In**

Pin the OneTap icon to your toolbar, click it, and sign in with Google.
